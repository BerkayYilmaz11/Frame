# Outcome — Frame Cloud brief shape

## T01 — Read shaped briefs in cloudBriefs.js

Added `shapedAt` to `normalizeBrief`, swapped `why` for `definition` (`''` when absent) in `normalizePart`, and added `shapeBrief` (POST `brief.shape`, returns `normalizeBriefDetail`) in `src/main/cloud/cloudBriefs.js`. Tests in `test/cloudBriefs.test.js` cover normalizing, the wire call and an `ALREADY_SHAPED` refusal. The panel still reads `part.why` until T02 and draws nothing in the meantime.
