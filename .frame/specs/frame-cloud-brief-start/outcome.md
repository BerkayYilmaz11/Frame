# Outcome — Frame Cloud brief start

## T01 — Read started briefs

Added `startedAt`/`recordRef` normalizing, `startBrief`, `START_REFUSALS` (seven codes, including `RECORD_REF_TAKEN`) and `startThrough` (returns `{ ok, detail }`) to `cloudBriefs.js`. Added the `started` history sentence and `startedLine` to `cloudBriefsCopy.js`, both checked against FrameCloud `feat/brief-start` (`data.count`). The Parts tab joins Shaped and Started on one line and shows `recordRef` as muted text on each part row, reusing existing classes, so no CSS changed yet. Files: cloudBriefs.js, cloudBriefsCopy.js, cloudBriefsPanel.js, and both test files.

## T02 — The pure builders

Wrote `cloudStart.js` with the pure builders and exported `TRANSLITERATE` from `cloudProjects.js`, tested in the new `test/cloudStart.test.js`. Deviations from plan.md: `specFiles` takes `slug`, which the required status.json needs; `-2`/`-3` spec slugs are shortened to stay within 48 characters; the definition splitter skips `## ` lines inside code fences; the fallback part number counts from 1. Also exported `taskTitle` (the 60-character cut) so it is tested on its own.

## T03 — The prepare view and the request handler

Added `pickBase`, `prepareView` and `handleStartRequest` to `cloudStart.js`, tested with fakes, including that the refs sent equal the refs written. Deviations: `prepareView` takes no `specSlugs`/`taskIds` (the dialog shows no refs); the handler reads the brief itself through `call`, and an unknown `beginPartId` is a `badRequest` refusal. `stash: true` on a clean folder stashes nothing, and `stashMessage` is then null. Refusals carry `detail` (the branch name, the target branch, or the parse reason) for the copy to name.

## T04 — Git helpers

Added `currentBranch`, `remoteBranchExists` and `stashAll` to `gitBranchesManager.js`, exported `localBranchExists`, and gave `createBranch` a trailing `{ track }` option that adds `--no-track`. Checked by hand against a scratch repo: `stash -u` took an untracked file, and a branch cut from `origin/dev` with `track: false` has no upstream. `currentBranch` returns '' on a detached HEAD.

## T05 — The service and its wiring

Wrote `cloudStartService.js` (`prepare`, `start`, `init`, `setupIPC`), added the two IPC channels, and wired the service in `index.js`. Deviations: `index.js` also calls `cloudStartService.init(window)` so the service can push `TASKS_DATA` after writing rows (tasksManager hides its own writes from the watcher). The spec and task writes refuse to overwrite a folder or id that the new branch already holds, which surfaces as `partial`. Followup: allocation reads the current branch's `.frame/`, not the base's; checking the base tree too (`git ls-tree`) would avoid that partial.

## T06 — The Start Work words and button

Added `workStage` `'start'` and the Start Work copy (labels, dialog words, `startErrorMessage`, `partialMessage`, `startedNotice`, `partProblemMessage`, part link labels) to `cloudBriefsCopy.js`, and a primary Start Work button on the card and in the detail in `cloudBriefsPanel.js`. Deviation: `startErrorMessage` takes the refusal object (`{ reason, part, detail }`), not a bare reason. One existing assertion (shaped work → `'none'`) was updated to a started brief, because the spec overturns it. The button clicks are wired with the dialog in T07.

## T07 — The Start Work dialog

Wrote `cloudStartDialog.js` (prepare, choices, a branch field that follows the choice until edited, base line, problems, the dirty warning, and refusal/partial sentences), wired Start Work's clicks in `cloudBriefsPanel.js` with the `startedNotice` toast and a reload, and added the dialog's styles to `cloud-briefs.css`. Begin with the first part is the default choice. A `dirty` answer from start reopens the warning instead of stashing. After `partial` the confirm is removed and the board reloads.

## T08 — Open the Begin lane

Exported `runTaskWithOptions` from `tasksPanel.js` and added `openBeginLane` to `cloudBriefsPanel.js`: `/spec.plan` through `dispatchSpecCommand` for a spec part, and the task run with `branchMode: 'current'` then `UPDATE_TASK` `in_progress` for a task part. Create only opens nothing. The lane uses the current AI tool (the dispatch default), as planned.

## T09 — Link part rows to their records

Added `showSpec` and `showTask` to `agentDispatch.js`. The Parts tab's plain-text `recordRef` from T01 is now a link that opens the spec in the Specs grid or the task on the Tasks board. Beyond plan: a task link whose id this folder does not hold shows a toast (`partNotHereMessage` in `cloudBriefsCopy.js`, tested). A missing spec opens the grid's empty drawer as `specsDashboard` does today.

## T11 — A started brief's progress on the card and in the Parts tab

Added T11 after the first walk (the Active card only counted parts): the decisions are appended to plan.md as an addendum. `addPartCounts` now also returns part rows, and `partStatus`/`partsSummary` in `cloudBriefsCopy.js` hold the rules. `cloudBriefsPanel.js` draws a row per part on started cards and in the Parts tab, kept live by `SPEC_DATA`, `TASKS_DATA` and lane activity. `agentDispatch.enterLane` was added for the row's lane link. Run dispatches the spec's next command by phase or opens the task's Run modal.
