# Outcome — Frame Cloud projects

## T01 — callTrpc query input and access removal

Made `callTrpc` encode GET input as `?input=<url-encoded JSON>` (omitted when there is none) and exported it; removed `access` from `runSignIn`, `sessionFromMe`, `sessionStore.pickSession`, `cloudSession`'s `PUBLIC_KEYS` and `signedInState`, and the Plan row from `index.html` / `frameSettingsModal.js`. The test fake now records the query separately so route keys stay path-only; added GET/POST encoding and no-`access` session tests. Files: deviceFlow.js, sessionStore.js, cloudSession.js, index.html, frameSettingsModal.js, test/cloudDeviceFlow.test.js.

## T02 — Pure core: reading, matching, web links

Created `src/main/cloud/cloudProjects.js` with `listProjects`, `normalizeProject`, `matchFolders` (identity-only match; a project row's `connected` is the server's link state, so a project linked by a folder elsewhere still reads Connected with no folder names) and `buildWebUrl` (origin-only, slug-shape check, https API needs https web origin unless the web host is loopback). Started `test/cloudProjects.test.js` with a fake fetch that decodes `?input=`. `buildWebUrl` checks slug shape only; the reserved-word list arrives with T03's `validateSlug`.

## T03 — Pure core: linking, slugs, row planning

Added the five link calls, `classifyLinkError`, `suggestSlug` / `validateSlug` / `nextSlug`, `planFolderRow` and `shouldAutoShowDevices` to `cloudProjects.js`, with tests for every case the task lists. Beyond the plan: `release()` itself turns `FRAME_PROJECT_MISMATCH` into `{ ok: true, notOwner: true }`; `planFolderRow` takes the folder's own id as an optional third argument and returns all candidates as `options` for the picker; `validateSlug` returns a reason code (`empty|length|format|reserved`) instead of a boolean. Files: src/main/cloud/cloudProjects.js, test/cloudProjects.test.js.

## T04 — Session hooks and stored web origin

Added `getAuth`, `onChange` (fired from `setState` with `{ state, userStarted }`, true only on `signIn()`'s success), `sessionExpired` (refresh's 401 branch now calls it), `reRegister`, and exported `openUrl` plus `fetchJson` from `cloudSession.js`. `webOrigin` (origin of the verification URL) is a main-only variable: saved at sign-in, carried through `refresh()`, restored on load, cleared on sign-out/expiry, and persisted by `sessionStore.pickSession`. Deviation: `fetchJson` is exported too, so the projects service shares the 15 s `net.fetch` wrapper. Files: cloudSession.js, sessionStore.js.

## T05 — Projects service and IPC

Created `cloudProjectsService.js` (folder scan, remote read, one auth wrapper, `userData/cloud-projects.json` cache, three-at-a-time candidates, token-free push) and wired it in `src/main/index.js`; added the nine `CLOUD_PROJECTS_*` / `CLOUD_LINK_*` / `CLOUD_OPEN_ON_WEB` channels. Choices beyond the plan: the list re-reads on entering signed-in or on a user-started sign-in, not on every `device.me` re-save; link handlers return `{ ok, reason, field?, suggestion? }` instead of throwing; `release` treats `PROJECT_NOT_FOUND` as detached; link actions refuse with `network` while the list is stale; `CLOUD_CHECK_SLUG` validates locally first and suggests `nextSlug` when the slug is taken. Files: cloudProjectsService.js, ipcChannels.js, src/main/index.js.

## T06 — Frame Cloud modal shell

Added `#cloud-btn` (rail foot, above the gear, hidden while `unavailable`) and `#cloud-overlay` (wide `settingsOverlay`), and created `cloudHub.js` with the moved sign-in panes (renamed `cloud-*`), the signed-in header, the tab strip, `open/toggle/signIn/signOut/accountState` and the guarded landing after sign-in. Settings → Account shrank to one row; the palette repointed `cloud.signIn`/`cloud.signOut` and gained `cloud.open`; `onboarding.js` exports `isOpen`; account styles moved to the new `cloud-hub.css`. Deviations: the tooltip text is fixed when attached, so `index.js` swaps in a fresh copy of the button whenever its label changes (this avoids touching `tooltip.js`, which is outside the Files list), and the onboarding/tour guard plus the tab renderer are passed into `cloudHub.init()`.

## T07 — Cloud projects tab

Created `cloudHubTabs.js` (passed to `cloudHub.init` as its tab renderer) and drew the Cloud projects tab: name/slug, source mark, Connected/Not connected, folder name(s) or "—", with Open (select + close), Connect a folder… (switch to On this device with the project id) and Open on the web (via `CLOUD_OPEN_ON_WEB`, only on rows without a folder here and with a per-row `canOpenWeb`); loading, error, stale and empty states with Retry. Server strings go through `textContent` only; row styles added to `cloud-hub.css`. Files: cloudHubTabs.js, cloudHub.js (comment), index.js, cloud-hub.css.

## T08 — On this device tab

Drew On this device in `cloudHubTabs.js`: Can be connected / Not in Frame Cloud / a pending "looking for matches" group / Connected, with the picker, the create form (debounced `CLOUD_CHECK_SLUG`, `-2` suggestion), inline remote-mismatch and different-identity questions (D4 copy), sequential Connect selected (n) that never answers a question, inline Disconnect, the S7 line, and stale-state disabling; styles in `cloud-hub.css`. Deviations: local slug validation runs through `CLOUD_CHECK_SLUG` (main validates before any request) instead of requiring main's core in the renderer, so editing the name does not re-suggest the slug; a pending group was added for folders whose candidates have not arrived. Followup: a shared pure `slug` module under `src/shared/` would let the renderer re-suggest slugs as the name changes.

## T09 — After-sign-in prompt

Made `cloudHub.js` handle a projects push with `autoShowDevices`: when the modal is open it switches to On this device and shows "<n> projects on this device aren't in <workspace>." with **Don't show again** (writes `cloudConnectPromptDismissed` via `SET_USER_SETTING`); the notice hides on reopen or when leaving the tab. It never opens the modal itself, so a landing blocked by onboarding or the tour stays blocked; launch and silent refreshes can't trigger it because main sets the flag only after a user-started sign-in. Files: src/renderer/cloudHub.js.
