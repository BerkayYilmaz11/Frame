/**
 * cloudShape — the pure core of shaping a Frame Cloud work brief.
 *
 * Shape opens a lane whose agent reads an open, unshaped work brief and the
 * code, agrees a split with the user, and on the user's yes writes every part
 * at once (`brief.shape`). Like Discuss (cloudDiscussions.js), the agent
 * reaches main through a staged command and a file bus; the command carries
 * only a shape id that main issued at Shape, so the token, the brief id and
 * the project slug never reach the terminal.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: the store is a plain object that each operation
 * returns anew, and request handling takes its calls as `deps`, so
 * `cloudShapeService.js` is a thin shell and `node --test` runs every branch
 * without Electron, a file or the network.
