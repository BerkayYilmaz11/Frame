/**
 * Specs dashboard filter model — what the grid shows for a given scope,
 * phase, search and done window.
 *
 * Pure by design (boards-done-window spec, D7): a function over the spec
 * list, so the scope × phase × window × search rules are testable and
 * `specsDashboard.js` only renders what comes back.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - scope `all` / `active` / `done` — `done` is `phase === 'done'`, active
 *   is everything else (a malformed spec is not done, so it is active).
 * - `phase` narrows only while scope is `active`; every phase chip is a
 *   subset of Active, so outside it the value is ignored.
 * - a non-null `searchMatches` (Set of slugs) narrows the pool first and
 *   switches the window off: a query is explicit intent (D5).
 * - in `all` and `done`, done specs older than `windowDays` are dropped
 *   from `visible` and reported as `olderCount`, unless `showOlder`.
 *   Active is never windowed. Age is read from `updated_at` (D6).
 * - `counts` answer "what will I see if I click": they follow the search
 *   pool and, for `all` / `done`, the window. `doneTotal` is the unwindowed
 *   done count for the tooltip.
