/**
 * App Loader
 *
 * Full-screen splash shown on boot until the first WORKSPACE_DATA arrives.
 * Avoids the brief flash of empty sidebar / unmounted terminal that users
 * see while the main process loads workspace state.
 *
 * It also plays Frame's intro: the mark fills along its own perimeter like a
 * progress ring, then the wordmark unrolls out of it and pushes it left. The
 * splash leaves only once BOTH the intro has finished and workspace data has
 * arrived — whichever is slower — so the animation is never cut mid-beat and
 * a slow boot never adds the intro's length on top of itself.
 *
 * Where it would have left, it asks whether this is a first run: with no
 * projects the surface is handed to onboarding.js instead, keeping the lockup
 * exactly where the intro put it (first-run-onboarding-screen spec). That is
 * also why the splash is parked rather than removed — the palette's Show
 * the Start Screen reuses this same element, and its same lockup, later.
 *
 * If the failsafe timeout fires before any data, the splash swaps to a
 * "couldn't load workspace" state with a Retry button instead of silently
 * dropping the user into a blank app. Main has no error variant for
 * LOAD_WORKSPACE — the timeout is the only failure signal the renderer has.
