/**
 * Task run prompt — what Play hands the agent, and whether the task is
 * ready to start.
 *
 * Pure by design (tasks-list-view spec, D11): `tasksPanel.js` requires
 * `electron`, so its prompt builder delegates here, where it can be tested.
 * Every Play surface — the Tasks screen, Home's Active Tasks widget and the
 * task tab's Start Working — goes through `tasksPanel.openRunFlow`, so they
 * all get the same prompt (D1).
 *
 * Readiness (D15): a task is ready when `description` and
 * `acceptanceCriteria` are both non-empty after trimming. A task that is not
 * opens with a format step: the agent writes the missing fields into
 * tasks.json, shows the acceptance criteria and waits for confirmation. A
 * spec task is always ready — its body lives in the spec's `tasks.md`, which
 * the sync owns. The agent never invents `userRequest`: a task that has none
 * keeps none.
