/**
 * The onboarding screen's gate (first-run-onboarding-screen spec, D4 / D5).
 *
 * Two questions, one answer: does the first-run screen show, and can it be
 * dismissed with Escape or a ×. Everything that decides it lives here, with
 * no DOM and no `ipcRenderer`, so the branching part of the surface is
 * testable even though the surface itself is not — the same split
 * `dock/dockState.js` and `home/agentRows.js` make.
 *
 * The screen is gated on the project count alone. Nothing is persisted when
 * the user skips: a skip is for that launch, and the screen stops appearing
 * the moment a project exists rather than the moment someone dismisses it.
