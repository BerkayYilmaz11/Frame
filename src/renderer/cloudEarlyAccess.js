/**
 * cloudEarlyAccess — the words the Frame Cloud window says while the server

 *
 * FrameCloud only creates an account through an invite link (its
 * `early-access` spec), so the signed-out window leads with the waitlist and
 * keeps sign-in for people who already have an invite. When the server is not
 * invite-only, or cannot say, the window is today's (`paneMode` → classic).
 * Pure: no DOM, no Electron, so `node --test` covers it.
