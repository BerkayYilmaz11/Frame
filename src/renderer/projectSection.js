/**
 * Projects Section
 *
 * The Projects rail view: a thin wrapper over the workspace panel, which
 * `projectListUI` renders and owns. The active project is shown by the
 * switcher above.
 *
 * It used to pin an "Add new Project" CTA under the panel, shown only while
 * no project was selected. That went on 2026-09-16: the first-run screen and
 * Home's no-project state both carry the three ways into a project now, and a
 * third, differently-worded answer in the sidebar was one too many. What is
 * left in its place is the opposite move — with no project the panel has
 * nothing to show at all, so the sidebar collapses to its rail and gives the
 * width back to the screen that is actually asking the question.
